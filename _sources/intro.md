:::{tab-item} Things I learned
- Many documentation websites I know use the Jupyter Book layout. This made it easy to see Jupyter Book's potential through real world examples.
- Jupyter Book can be used for many creative purposes, such as hosting the digital portfolio featured in this assignment.

:::{tab-item} Things I found difficult
- Understanding and utilizing MyST Markdown was difficult as it only renders when I build my book so I cannot preview how it will look.
- I'd like to practice writing READMEs more as READMEs are how I communicate the details of my repository to the rest of the world.
